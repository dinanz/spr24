    "### Structure of a relational database\n",
    "- Columns are attributes\n",
    "- Rows are entries\n",
    "- Primary key: usually one column, used to identify entries\n",
    "- Attributes have constraints, or `domains`\n",
    "- Relations/attributes are somewhat \n",
    "### Database schema\n",
    "- The design of a table; table definition\n",
    "- Relation schema: list of attributes foa a particular relation and their domains\n",
    "- Relational instance: a relation with particular values; like a value of a variable\n",
    "- A column can be primary key for one table and foreign key for another\n",
    "### Key\n",
    "- `Superkey`: set of attributes that uniquely identifies an entry\n",
    "- `Candidate key`: a superkey that is minimal; no subset of it is also a superkey\n",
    "#### Primary key\n",
    "- May be more than 1 candidate key for a table\n",
    "- `Primary key`: a candidate key that is chosen to be unique identifer for entries\n",
    "    - Can be a single column or a composite primary key from multiple columns\n",
    "    - Constraints: must be defined and unique\n",
    "    - Defined in the CREATE\n",
    "    - Often arbitrarily generated\n",
    "- `Foreign keys`: reference to primary keys from another table\n",
    "    - Defined during CREATE\n",
    "### Query languages\n",
    "- 3 types\n",
    "    1. Imperative query langauge\n",
    "        - Specifies sequence of operations on CRUD\n",
    "    2. Functional query language\n",
    "        - Expressed as series of functions to operate\n",
    "    3. Declarative query language\n",
    "        - Specifies information requested\n",
    "        - e.g. SQL\n",
