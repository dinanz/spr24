    "### Database management system\n",
    "- DBMS is a collection of data and the program to manage and access the data\n",
    "- not the data itself\n",
    "- the database is technically the data itself\n",
    "- In general 2 modes in which databases are used\n",
    "    1. Online transaction processing\n",
    "    2. Data analytics\n",
    "- CRUD\n",
    "## Issues with storing information in files not database\n",
    "- Data redundancy and inconsistency\n",
    "- Difficulty of accessing the data\n",
    "- Data isolation\n",
    "- Integrity problems\n",
    "- Atomicity problems\n",
    "- Concurrent access anomalies\n",
    "- Security problems\n",
    "### Data models\n",
    "- Relational model\n",
    "    - Data seen as interrelated tables (relations)\n",
    "    - Most popular model\n",
    "- Entity-relationship model\n",
    "    - Models relationships between \"entities\"\n",
    "    - Maps onto relational model: table=entity; entity instance=tuple\n",
    "    - Explicitly models cardinality\n",
    "- Semi-structured data model\n",
    "    - Different objects of same type may have different sets of attributes\n",
    "    - Often implemented in nonrelational databases like MongoDB\n",
    "- Object-based data model\n",
    "    - Allows storage of objects from OOP languages in a column\n",
    "### Data abstraction\n",
    "- Physical level: how the data is stored\n",
    "- Logical level: what data is stored, and relationships\n",
    "- View level: simplifies user interactino with databse\n",
    "### Database languages\n",
    "- Data definition language (DDL)\n",
    "    - Defines the database schema (how tables are related to one another)\n",
    "    - In relational model:\n",
    "        - Defines each table: column names and types\n",
    "        - Defines constraints\n",
    "- Data manipulation language (DML)\n",
    "    - Defines commands/queries\n",
    "    - CRUD\n",
    "    - Two types of DMLs\n",
    "        - Procedural: tells DBMS what info to retrive and method of retrieval\n",
    "        - Declarative: tells DBMS what info to retrieve, but method is up to DBMS\n",
    "            - The part of DML involved with info retrieval is the `query language`\n",
    "            - SQL is a declarative DML\n",
    "- DDL and DML make up a single language\n",
    "### Accessing databases from application programs \n",
    "- Open database connectivity (ODBC), works with languages like C, Python, etc\n",
    "- Java database connectivity (JDBC)\n",
    "- Python has its own database API\n",
    "### Database design\n",
    "- Schema consists of design of each table\n",
    "- Relationship between tables (1-1, 1-n, n-1, n-n)\n",
    "- Design based on needs\n",
    "### Database engine\n",
    "- Heart of the system that stores the data and runs queries\n",
    "1. Storage manager\n",
    "    - Usually trees or hash tables\n",
    "    - Components\n",
    "        - `Authentication and integrity manager`\n",
    "            - Enforces user authentication and privileges\n",
    "            - Enforces integrity constraints like foreign key and uniqueness\n",
    "        - Transaction\n",
    "            - Ensures consistent state\n",
    "            - Transactions must be complete, otherwise they will be rolled back\n",
    "        - File manager\n",
    "        - Buffer Manager\n",
    "    - Data structures managed\n",
    "        - Data files\n",
    "        - Data dictionary\n",
    "            - Metadata about databases\n",
    "        - Indexes\n",
    "2. Query processor\n",
    "    - Translates queries into actual operations that retrieve data\n",
    "    - Functions\n",
    "        - DDL interpreter\n",
    "            - Reads data definition statements and stores them into data dictionary\n",
    "        - DML compiler translates DML statements into execution plan\n",
    "            - Performs `query optimisation`, selects most efficient plan\n",
    "        - Query execution engine\n",
    "            - Executes lower level commands generated by DML compiler\n",
    "3. Transaction manager\n",
    "    - Ensure the following\n",
    "        - Atomicity\n",
    "        - Consistency\n",
    "        - Durability\n",
    "        - Must not violate consistency constraints\n",
    "        - If inconsistent, roll back using `recovery manager`\n",
    "        - Concurrency\n",
    "### Database system architecture\n",
    "- Two basic architectures\n",
    "    1. two tier architecture: user interacts with application on their client machine, issueing queries to database on server machine\n",
    "    2. three tier architecture, user interacts with application on client machine, sends messages to application server on server machine, then queries database system\n",
    "### Database users and administrators\n",
    "- 3 types of users\n",
    "    1. Naive users\n",
    "        - Like an online shopper, no direct knowledge or interactino with database\n",
    "    2. Application programmers\n",
    "    3. Sophisticated users\n",
    "        - Do not wite programs but do write queries\n",
    "- Database administrators (DBA)\n",
    "    - Defines schemas, set up indices\n",
    "    - Modify schemas\n",
    "    - Grant permissions\n",
    "    - Conduct maintenance\n",
    "        - Monitor system jobs\n",
    "        - Backups\n",
    "        - Check storage space"
